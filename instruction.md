Best practices in terms of Folder structure and reusability of components

Instructions

Write the unit tests for the Alarm class. The Alarm class is designed to monitor the radioactivity in a nuclear power plant and set an alarm if the radioactivity falls outside of the expected range. The Sensor class provided for the exercise fakes the behavior of a real sensor, providing random but realistic values. Furthermore, here are some additional constraints:
you cannot use a mock framework.
you cannot modify the Sensor class, except maybe to make it implement an interface though it is not mandatory to solve the exercise.

You can also propose ameliorations or pinpoint issues with the Alarm class.
